This iOS app is designed to bring restaurant choices to users in a convenient way where they are able to like or unlike a given dining option with the swipe of a thumb. Muncher makes eating out not only easy but exciting – not only are established dining institutions provided, but also, any pop up or small business serving gourmet dishes from their personal kitchen get exposure through this app; we have given users the option to submit themselves as “restaurants” in order to promote their personal brands and provide a greater sense of community in local neighborhoods.

<b>Tab 1: Swipe</b>

Displays a variety of restaurants where users can swipe left or right depending on their personal tastes.
